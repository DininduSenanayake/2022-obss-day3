Genomic analyses may often be dependent on a reference genome assembly for a focal species. Reference genomes can be used to detect variant sites within or between populations with greater confidence than similar *de novo* approaches. As such, a first step in many population genomics projects will be sequencing and assembling a reference genome for the species of interest if no such resources yet exist. 

This one day workshop is designed to show you how to assemble a genome through hands-on analysis of Nanopore long reads and Illumina short reads, and highlight key considerations for the various steps in the workflow.
